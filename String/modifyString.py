# The lower() method returns the string in lower case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())

# Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
# a = " Hello, World! "
# print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"


# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.replace("H", "J"))

# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator
a = "Hello, World!"
b = a.split(",")
print(b)
